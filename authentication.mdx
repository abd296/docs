The Nomod API uses ApiKey Auth Scheme for authentication. To use the API, you will need to generate an API secret key for the platform.
This can be done easily through the Nomod App that is accessible through the settings of nomod app where you can generate the api key.

Here, you can revoke your API key to block access to the Nomod API. 

<Warning>
  If an unauthorised person gains access to your API Key they will be able use
  your account and can create link. Keep it somewhere safe and don't share it with
  anyone.
</Warning>

Currently, we support one key per business per integraion. Once you have generated a key, you will need to pass in the key
with every API request for us to process it successfully. Otherwise, an error with a code of 401 will be returned.

<Note>
  Changes made through the API will be attributed to the owner of business the API key is
  assigned to.

### Authentication Errors

_Error: API key not set or invalid_

**Solution:** Double-check your API key for any typos. If you’re copying it from a website or document, ensure there are no leading or trailing whitespaces. If the error persists, revoke the api key and generate a new one.
