The Nomod API uses an API Key Authentication Scheme. To use the API, you must generate an API secret key through the Nomod App. This can be done easily in the settings of the Nomod app, where you can generate the API key.

In the app settings, you can also revoke your API key to block access to the Nomod API when needed.

<Warning>
  If an unauthorized person gains access to your API Key, they will be able to use
  your account and may create links. Keep it secure and do not share it with anyone.
</Warning>

Currently, we support one key per business per integration. Once you have generated a key, you will need to include it with every API request for successful processing. Otherwise, an error with a code of 401 will be returned.

<Note>
  Changes made through the API will be attributed to the business owner to whom the API key is
  assigned.

### Authentication Errors

_Error: API key not set or invalid_

**Solution:** Double-check your API key for any typos. If youâ€™re copying it from a source, ensure there are no leading or trailing whitespaces. If the error persists, revoke the API key and generate a new one.
