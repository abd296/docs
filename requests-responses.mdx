title: "Requests and Responses"
---

This is a RESTful API. All requests use the base URL: https://apiv1.nomod.dev/.

Responses to each request are provided as a JSON object, containing either the requested data or a valid error message with an error code, as outlined below.

Here is a list of all the error codes the Nomod API may return if something does not go as expected:

| Error Code | Meaning                                                                                                               |
